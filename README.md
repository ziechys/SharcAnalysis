# SharcAnalysis

This is a collection of analysis scripts for SHARC, Surface Hopping including Arbitrary Couplings developed by the Gonz√°lez group (https://sharc-md.org/).

Some scripts are based on or slight modification of the scripts provided by SHARC (original scripts see: https://github.com/sharc-md/sharc)

## FT_analysis.py
Fourier transformation analysis of the relaxation dynamics in SHARC based on structural changes. 
Coded in style with SHARC's original scripts using traj_manip class and geo.py 

Script in progress.

Features:
- Define internal coordinates for Fourier Transformation anaylsis
- FT for each trajectory to obtain relevant frequencies in relaxation dynamics based on structural change
- Summed-up FT results over all trajectories
- Creation of coherent wave packet and FT analysis of its structural dynamics
- Various post-processing methods to improve FT
- Plotting of FT results
- pure excited state dynamics and normal mode analysis by detecting (forced) GShop 

Use ```python3 FT_analysis.py``` 

## trajana_nma.py
Normal mode analysis of SHARC trajectories.

Slight modifications of original SHARC script:

- conversion to python3
- fixing of several bugs to make it run
- modification of bar plotting routine
- modification of normal mode analysis (weighted vs. unweighted, coherent vs. total)
- pure excited state dynamics and normal mode analysis by detecting (forced) GShop 

Use ```python3 trajana_nma.py``` 

## single_traj_analysis.py
Analyse all trajectories of a run individually.
The following analysis is conducted: MCH energies, Diag energies, MCH amplitudes, Diag amplitudes, hopping probabilities, Geometry change (requested through Geo.inp)

Use ```python3 single_traj_analysis.py <path-to-trajectories> <number-of-states> <Geo.inp>``` 

## post_analysis.py
Script to analyse SHARC MD simulations with forced GShop.
The script checks if the trajectories behave ordinary befor the GShop and flags them if so or not (DONT_ANALZE flag).

Information output from the script (additional to SHARC's own diagnostics.py): 
- Same gradient in two subsequent time steps during simultion (indicated problem in quantum chemistry calculation)
- When does the GS hop occur
- Is the state changing after the GS hop (it should not)?
- What is T_use from diagnostics.py

Trajectories are groups in:
- no GS hop
- usable trajectory until GS hop, i.e. no criteria set in diagnostics.py or double gradients before GS hop
- not usable trajectories due to T_use > time of GS hop or double gradients before GS hop

Use ```python3 post_analysis.py <path-to-trajectories> <diagnostics.py output>``` 

## setup_traj.py
Setting up trajectories for SHARC run

Slight modifications of original SHARC script:

- fix bug for forced GShop
- include option to specify laserwidth

Use ```python2 setup_traj.py``` 

## corr_nan.py
Script to correct 'nan' bug occuring for forced GS hop setup.
Script reads MD output substitutes 'nan' entries in coefficient data with expected coefficient for a GS hop. 

Use ```python3 corr_nan.py <path-to-trajectories>``` 

## end_struc.py

Get all final structures of a MD run in one file (e.g. to view with Molden)

Use ```python3 end_struc.py <path-to-trajectories>```
